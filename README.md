# 地圖 (Jido)

![Jido preview](./assets/preview.png)

> **Note:** Previously known as **zfe**, this project has been renamed to 
**Jido** to better reflect its purpose and functionality.

**Jido** is a lightweight Unix TUI file explorer designed for speed and 
simplicity.

The name 地圖 (지도) translates to "map" in English, reflecting Jido's 
purpose: helping you navigate and explore your file system with ease. With 
Vim-like bindings and a minimalist interface, Jido focuses on speed and
simplicity.

## Configuration
Configure `jido` by editing the external configuration file located at either:
- `$HOME/.jido/config.json`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/jido/config.json`.

Jido will look for these env variables specifically. If they are not set, Jido will
not be able to find the config file.

An example config file can be found [here](https://github.com/BrookJeynes/jido/blob/main/example-config.json).
