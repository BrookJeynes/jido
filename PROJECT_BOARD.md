### New features

    - [ ] Copy folders.
- [ ] Keybind to unzip archives.
- [ ] Keybind to hard delete items (bypass trash).
- [ ] Ability to unbind keys.

### Refactors
- [ ] Better error logging.
      There are many places errors could be caught, logged, and handled instead
      of crashing.

      Current reading can be slow which pauses users movement if they are simply
      scrolling past.

### Bugs
- [ ] Command history is skipping items on scroll.
